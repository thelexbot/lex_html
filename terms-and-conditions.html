        <h6>Acceptance of Terms</h6>
        <p>
          By accessing and using TheLexBot (hereinafter referred to as "the
          Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions
          ("Terms"). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must
          not use the Service.
        </p>
        <h6>Description of Service</h6>
        <p>
          TheLexBot is an AI-powered legal research tool designed to assist
          lawyers, judges, corporate professionals, students, law professionals,
          and aspirants in India. The Service utilizes OpenAI's AI technology to
          analyze and process a proprietary dataset of Supreme Court of India
          rulings. This dataset is independently collected and maintained by
          Thelextbot. The information provided is for informational purposes
          only and does not constitute legal advice. While we aim to provide
          comprehensive coverage of Supreme Court rulings within our dataset,
          there may be limitations in the data coverage.
        </p>
        <h6>Disclaimer of Legal Advice</h6>
        <p>
          No Legal Advice: The information provided by TheLexBot, derived from
          our proprietary dataset of Supreme Court rulings, is not a substitute
          for professional legal advice. Users should consult with a qualified
          legal professional for advice tailored to their specific
          circumstances. Informational Purposes Only: The Service provides legal
          information and analysis based on our proprietary dataset of Supreme
          Court rulings, but it does not provide legal opinions or
          interpretations. User Responsibility: Users are solely responsible for
          their use of the information provided by TheLexBot.
        </p>
        <h6>AI Limitations and Accuracy</h6>

        <p>
          AI-Powered Analysis: The Service uses OpenAI's AI technology to
          analyze our proprietary dataset of Supreme Court rulings. While the AI
          is powerful, it may still generate inaccurate or incomplete
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proprietary Dataset Limitations: While we strive to maintain an
          accurate and up-to-date dataset, it may not be exhaustive. There can
          be limitations to the amount of data that is within our dataset.
          Dynamic Legal Landscape: Legal information, including Supreme Court
          precedents, is subject to change, and our dataset may not always
          reflect the most current laws and regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          No Guarantee of Accuracy: The Company does not guarantee the accuracy,
          completeness, or reliability of the information provided by TheLexBot,
          even regarding Supreme Court rulings within our dataset. Reliance at
          User's Risk: Users rely on the information provided by the Service,
          including analyses of Supreme Court rulings from our proprietary
          dataset, at their own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Supreme Court Ruling Data Limitations: While TheLexBot strives to
          provide comprehensive access to Supreme Court rulings, users
          acknowledge that the database may not contain all rulings, and there
          may be delays in the inclusion of recent rulings. Users should verify
